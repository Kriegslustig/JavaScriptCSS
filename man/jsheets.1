.SH NAME
.P
jsheets \- A simple CSS preprocessor that interprets JavaScript
.SH SYNOPSYS
.P
\fBjsheets \fIfile\fR\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Jsheets is a CSS preprocessor that executes JavaScript\. It also replaces function calls and variables inside CSS\. A simple approach to CSS preprocessing\.
.SH SYNTAX
.P
There are three things special about jsheets:
.SS The \fB$\fR Object
.P
Inside CSS the whole \fB$\fR object is availible to you\. That's it\.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
div {
  background: $\.someColor;
}
.fi
.RE
.SS \fBimport\fR
.P
With \fBimport\fR you can import files to a jsheet\. Its usage is straight forward:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
import 'somefile\.jsheet'
.fi
.RE
.SS \fBcss()\fR
.P
With the \fBcss\fR function you can output css\. So you can do:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
css('div {display: block}')
.fi
.RE
.SS helpers
.P
Because underscore is used in the project, I thought i'd pass it to the jsheets\. There are also some helpers provided inside the \fB$\fR object\.
.SS $
.P
\fB$\.$\fR is a function that executes and returns what is passed to it\. So for example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
div {
  width: $\.$(100 * 30)px
}
.fi
.RE
.P
You cannot use braces inside of a call to \fB$\.$\fR\|\. That's because the \fB$\fR variables and functions are replaced using a mediocar RegEx\.
.SH ROADMAP
.P
I'm pretty ok with the package as it stands right now\. But there are a lot of things I plan to implement\.
